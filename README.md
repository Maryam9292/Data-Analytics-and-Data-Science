# Car Purchase Forecasting Project

## Description
This project predicts the amount a person might spend on buying a car based on their salary, age, income tax, and savings. It is designed to assist individuals in planning their finances for a car purchase and provides valuable insights into spending behavior.

## Features
- Analyze the relationship between salaries, savings, income tax, and car purchase budgets.
- Forecast spending amounts using statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Visualize trends and patterns in car purchase behavior.

## How It Works
The project uses historical data to train a forecasting model. Key variables considered include:
- **Salary**: Annual income of the individual.
- **Age**: To analyze trends based on different age groups.
- **Income Tax**: The impact of taxation on disposable income.
- **Savings**: The existing financial reserves of the individual.

The model predicts a potential budget for car purchases based on these variables.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for building and evaluating models)
