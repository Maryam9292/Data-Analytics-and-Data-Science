# 👋 Hello, I’m Maryam

I’m a **passionate and driven Data Analyst** with a curiosity for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. My mission is to help businesses make evidence-based decisions by combining robust analysis with compelling visual storytelling.

## 🔥 My Enthusiasm

- I love diving into messy datasets and discovering hidden patterns.  
- I thrive on the “aha!” moment when a chart or model finally reveals the business story.  
- Continuous learning is my fuel—whether it’s a new Python library, a BI tool feature, or the latest in machine learning algorithms.
